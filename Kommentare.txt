atomich parameters.py

* get rid of while loop and move logic to for loop / avoid iterating over line twice


main.py
* split up ui and shell code in separate files
* unify language e.g. abfrage_variable and su_eingabe. i'd stick to english all the time 

single_cristal_data

* get rid of try/expect in for loop (expect case will never be reached due to if statement)
	attention: there are some errors which can appear especially in the lower part of the function
